        <h3>True Random Music Player Python3</h3>
        <em><small>Published: 2021 June 8th</small></em>
        <hr>

        This Python script will give true random track playing using the AUD QRNG (when API success) and uuid4 (when API fails). I know that uuid4 is not exacly true, but it is probably the best alternative to grabbing true random numbers from the internet API. The user still has to manually configure the vlc PATH when using this script, i.e. where is the VLC on your computer. The default PATH given is for an Ubuntu native VLC install (not snap). Also, the probability of the first and last track might be a bit skewed, so I will fix it in the future. However, the randomness should be alright for its intent and purposes.

        <br><br>

        Another issue is that it is unable to track user interaction with the playback speed in real time, so if the track is let's say 240 seconds, then if the user changes the playback speed to 3x, then track will finish playing in 80 seconds, while the wait timer will remain at 240 seconds, leaving 160 seconds where the user hears nothing

        <br><br>

        Another problem is that there is a slight delay in API the random number from the ANU QRNG, so the there might be a 1 sec delay before the next track starts playing.

        <br><br>

        Hopefully, if I get some more free time, I will fix these problems in the future.

        <br><br>

        Here are the libraries that need to be installed from command prompt/terminal before running the script.

        <br>
        <br> 
        <code>
        python3 -m pip install quantumrandom
        <br>
        python3 -m pip install natsort
        <br>
        python3 -m pip install uuid
        <br>
        </code>

        <br>
        <br>

        You should not need to install the other libaries imported since they should come with the default Python3 installation. You can find the information about these libraries easily on PyPI
